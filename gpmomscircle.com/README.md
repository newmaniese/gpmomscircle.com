This is a simple [Pelican Website](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/), deployed on AWS S3 via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/newmaniese/gpmomscircle.com).

To update the content or pages, look under the content directory. These documents for simplicity can be written in [Markdown](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) where they will then be rendered in the theme.

Pushing these changes onto master will start the deployment process.

The theme was created and currently maintained by Michael Newman.
