Lindsey Schorer, President
I'm Lindsey Schorer and I am honored to be President for GPMC this year after serving as Treasurer last year and Brunch Bunch coordinator for a few years, too. My husband Anthony and I live in Grosse Pointe Woods with our three kids. I grew up out of state but have lived here for 11 years. I am so happy to have found this circle and the many outlets it provides for moms and children. It can be quite an adjustment to stay at home parenting and this circle has helped immensely. I have met so many wonderful women and I love that you can be a little or a lot involved depending on your comfort level and your free time. I encourage you to become a part of this group - you will not regret it!
