We provide a support network for at-home mothers throughout the Grosse Pointe and Harper Woods, Michigan communities.

We are over 100 members strong, and we are a 100 percent member-led organization. Every member is encouraged to volunteer, participate and share her ideas and talents. Our goal is to enrich families and promote a sense of community that is open to all.

Our members enjoy monthly activities such as Brunch Bunch, Potluck Playdate, Coffee Club, Fitness Outings, Momâ€™s Night Out, Cocktails & Cuisine, and Social with complimentary childcare, among so much more. Our many playgroups, weekly summer park playdates and private Facebook group provide our members with frequent, much-needed communication and companionship. Our moms also participate in many community service projects throughout the year.

Our dues are $45 per year. To become a member, [please click here](/pages/membership.html). For more information contact our Membership VP at GPMCmembership@gmail.com
